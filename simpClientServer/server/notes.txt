  In order for a server to function, the socket must be binded using the bind
command. Once bound, the program can then issue a listen command to the socket,
providing the backlog. This tells the operating system that the program is now
ready to accept incoming connections. Now, the accept command is issued, which
(pauses the program)[Not verified], and waits for a client. Once the client
connects, the command issues a new file descriptor pointing to a socket
connected to the client.

CLIENT ADDRESS WILL BE NECCESARY
