  This routing functionality will use a routing file, which will specify
the route, and the file that the route points to. This file will use a
single 8-bit integer at the beginning, specifying the number of routes
included in the file. Then, two more 8-bit integers will specify the
length of the route string, and the route file string, which will both
be placed in order as such. This file format will be specified by a
struct, and will be placed in the main.c router file.
