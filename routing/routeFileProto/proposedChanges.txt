IMPORTANT CHANGE #1:

  The routing file format's route string, and file string; should switch
places. This is in order to make it easier to check file integrity.
Since the first character of a route string will always start with '/',
the integrity checker will know when the file string ends; and it will
know when the route string ends, by checking for a non-letter byte.

POSSIBLE ISSUES WITH CHANGE #1:

  It may cause problems for any string larger than 45 bytes, if a simple
check is performed for any char larger than '.' within the ascii table.
And, it may cause problems for any "string size" byte that happens to
correspond to a letter, or '/'.

  Long story short, boundary checks that are performed with the
anticipation that every entry will end with certain bytes, will restrict
those bytes to be placed into a certain location. If the integrity
checker is to be implemented, certain ascii codes will be required to be
at certain locations within the route file.
